## Todos for student-directory

- [ ] Change 'Type first student' message in ln:45 when students.count > 1 to say 'Input a new student's name'
- [ ]  Puts blank lines when printing to terminal to create ease of readability.
- [ ] Align the content in the commands menu
- [ ] Create student Class so a new student can be created with Student.new(name,age,country,cohort)
- [ ] On startup, if there is a students.csv file with students in, and no arguments have been passed to directory.rb, tell them you have found a list of students (and how many) and ask if they would like to load them.
